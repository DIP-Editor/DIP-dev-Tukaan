# DIP-dev-Tukaan

A complete rewrite of the DIP code editor using the Tukaan framework

## What is DIP?

DIP (standing for `Development In Progress`) is meant to be a custom Code Editor that is highly flexible and provides a space where development happens efficiently. The goal (for when it is completed) is that it will be lightweight, fast, and minimal with many normal features redesigned to be simpler (I.E. no LSP but still with builtin autocorrect). Inspired from past DIP/JDE projects and Porcupine by @Akuli.
